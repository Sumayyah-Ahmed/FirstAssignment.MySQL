# For Data definition and Modifying Data.

I created a database to keep track of employees and departments. I assumed that each employee works in a single department.    

1. I Wrote a SQL statement to create the database.
2. I created two tables that are required for the store. 
3. I added a primary key, and one table has a foreign key and the related foreign key constraints.
4. I Inserted at two rows in each of the tables.
5. Tables have information about employees as first name, last name, employee id and hiring date.
